# About gskinner
We exist to build inovative digital experiences for smart clients, and we love how easy Flutter makes that experience. Don't hesitate to stop by our site to learn more about what we do. We'd love to hear from you!

### Installation

If you're new to Flutter the first thing you'll need is to follow the [setup instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). 

Once Flutter is setup, you'll need to switch to the latest `dev` version:
 * Run `flutter channel dev`
 * Run `flutter upgrade`

If you've never run a desktop build before, you will need to enable it with a one-time command for your current platform:
* `flutter config --enable-macos-desktop`
* `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop`
* `flutter config --enable-linux-desktop`

Once you're on `dev` and desktop is enabled, you're ready to run the app:
* `flutter run -d windows`
* `flutter run -d macos`
* `flutter run -d linux`
* `flutter run -d android`
* `flutter run -d ios`
* `flutter run -d web`

If you re-start your IDE, you should also see a new launch option for your current desktop 

### Client Keys
This repo includes a set of Keys for Cloudinary and Firebase that are on the free pricing plans. Depending on traffic, these may reach their limit. If that happens, you will need to to provide your own keys in order to run the app locally, those can be found in `AppKeys.dart`. These limits should refresh each month, so your mileage will vary here.
